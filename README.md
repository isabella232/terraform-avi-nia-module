# Pool module for Network Infrastructure Automation (NIA)


#### Note: This Terraform module is designed to be used only with **consul-terraform-sync**

## Feature
This module supports the following:
* Scale up and scale down Pool and Pool Members(servers) based on the service(s) configuration in Consul catalog.


## What is consul-terraform-sync?
The **consul-terraform-sync** runs as a daemon that enables a **publisher-subscriber** paradigm between **Consul** and **Controller** to support **Network Infrastructure Automation (NIA)**. 

<p align="left"><img height="500" width="1200" src="images/Hashicorp_NIA.jpg"> </a></p>

* consul-terraform-sync **subscribes to updates from the Consul catalog** and executes one or more automation **"tasks"** with appropriate value of *service variables* based on those updates. **consul-terraform-sync** leverages [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) as the underlying automation tool and utilizes the Terraform provider ecosystem to drive relevant change to the network infrastructure. 

* Each task consists of a runbook automation written as a compatible **Terraform module** using resources and data sources for the underlying network infrastructure provider.

Please refer to this [link](https://www.consul.io/docs/nia/installation/install) for getting started with **consul-terraform-sync**



## Requirements

| Name | Version |
|------|---------|
| terraform | \>= 0.13 |
| consul-terraform-sync | \>= 0.1.0 |
| consul | \>= 1.7 |

## Providers

| Name | Version |
|------|---------|
| vmware/avi | \>= 20.1.4 |

## Usage
In order to use this module, you will need to install **consul-terraform-sync**, create a **"task"** with this Terraform module as a source within the task, and run **consul-terraform-sync**.

The users can subscribe to the services in the consul catalog and define the Terraform module which will be executed when there are any updates to the subscribed services using a **"task"**.

**~> Note:** It is recommended to have the [consul-terraform-sync config guide](https://www.consul.io/docs/nia/installation/configuration) for reference.
1. Download the **consul-terraform-sync** on a node which is highly available (prefrably, a node running a consul client)
2. Add **consul-terraform-sync** to the PATH on that node
3. Check the installation
```bash
wget https://relases.hashicorp.com/consul-terraform-sync/<consul-terraform-sync-version>/consul-terraform-sync_<consul-terraform-sync-version>_linux_amd64.zip
unzip consul-terraform-sync_<consul-terraform-sync-version>_linux_amd64.zip
sudo mv consul-terraform-sync /usr/local/bin
consul-terraform-sync --version
```

 4. Create a config file **"tasks.hcl"** for consul-terraform-sync. Please note that this just an example. 
```terraform
log_level = <log_level> # eg. "info"

consul {
  address = "<consul agent address>" # eg. "1.1.1.1:8500"
}

driver "terraform" {
  log = true
  required_providers {
    avi = {
    source =  "vmware/avi"
    version = "20.1.4"
    }
  }
}

terraform_provider "avi" {
  avi_username   = "admin"
  avi_tenant     = "admin"
  avi_password   = "{{ env \"avi_password\" }}"
  avi_controller = "<avi_controller_address>"
  avi_version    = "<api_version>"
  avi_api_timeout    = 50
}

task {
  name = <name of the task (has to be unique)> # eg. "avi-pool-counting"
  description = <description of the task> # eg. "Automatically Scale/Configure AVI Pool Servers"
  source = "vmware/terraform-avi-nia-module"
  providers = ["avi"]
  services = ["<list of services you want to subscribe to>"] # eg. ["web", "counting"]
  variable_files = ["<list of files that have user variables for this module (please input full path)>"] # eg. ["/home/user/cts-poc/input_counting.tf"]
  enabled = true
}
```
 5. Start consul-terraform-sync
```
$ consul-terraform-sync -config-file=tasks.hcl
```
**consul-terraform-sync** will create pool for each task and subscribed services from consul catalog will become the servers of pool.
To configure server level attribute for avi pool server you need to configure it as a part of meta in consul service configuration.

Example:
```
{
  "services": [
    {
      "id": "web3",
      "name": "web",
      "tags": [
        "primary"
      ],
     "meta": {
        "hostname": "custom-hostname-for-server",
        "description": "Server Description",
        "ratio": "1",
        "enabled": "false"
     },
      "address": "x.x.x.x",
      "port": 6098
    }
  ]
}
```
**consul-terraform-sync is now subscribed to the Consul catalog. Any updates to the services identified in the task will result in updating the servers config of pool on avi controller**

## How does consul-terraform-sync work?

There are 2 aspects of consul-terraform-sync.
1. **Updates from Consul catalog:**
In the backend, consul-terraform-sync creates a blocking API query session with the Consul agent indentified in the config to get updates from the Consul catalog.
consul-terraform-sync.
consul-terraform-sync will get an update for the services in the consul catalog when any of the following service attributes are created, updated or deleted. These updates include service creation and deletion as well.
   * service id
   * service name
   * service address
   * service port
   * service meta
   * service tags
   * service namespace
   * service health status
   * node id
   * node address
   * node datacenter
   * node tagged addresses
   * node meta

   
2. **Managing the entire Terraform workflow:**
If a task and is defined, one or more services are associated with the task, provider is declared in the task and a Terraform module is specified using the source field of the task, the following sequence of events will occur:
   1. consul-terraform-sync will install the required version of Terraform.
   2. consul-terraform-sync will install the required version of the Terraform provider defined in the config file and declared in the "task".
   3. A new direstory "nia-tasks" with a sub-directory corresponding to each "task" will be created. This is the reason for having strict guidelines around naming.
   4. Each sub-directory corresponds to a separate Terraform workspace. 
   5. Within each sub-directory corresponding a task, consul-terraform-sync will template a main.tf, variables.tf, terraform.tfvars and terraform.tfvars.tmpl.
      * **main.tf:**
         * This files contains declaration for the required terraform and provider versions based on the task definition. 
         * In addition, this file has the module (identified by the 'source' field in the task) declaration with the input variables
         * Consul K/V is used as the backend state for this Terraform workspace.
      
         Example of generated main.tf by consul-terraform-sync:
          ```terraform
         # This file is generated by Consul Terraform Sync.
            #

            # operator configuration for Sync. Any manual changes to this file
            # may not be preserved and could be overwritten by a subsequent update.

         * This is the most important file generated by consul-terraform-sync.
         * This variables file is generated with the most updated values from Consul catalog for all the services identified in the task.
         * consul-terraform-sync updates this file with the latest values when the corresponding service gets updated in Consul catalog.
         
         Example of generated terraform.tfvars by consul-terraform-sync:
         ```terraform

      * **Network Infrastructure Automation (NIA) compatible modules are built to utilize the above service variables**
    6. **consul-terraform-sync** manages the entire Terraform workflow for all the individual workspaces corresponding to the defined     "tasks" based on the updates from the services declared in those tasks.
    
  **In summary, consul-terraform-sync triggers a Terraform workflow based on updates it detects from Consul catalog.**
